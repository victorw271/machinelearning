<h1 align="center">Machine Learning Engineering Assignment</h1>

<p align="center">Welcome to the repository of my Machine Learning Engineering assignment. In this repository, we explore the exciting world of machine learning and put our engineering skills to the test. From data preprocessing to model evaluation, we've got it all covered!</p>

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

### [Assignment 1](mle)
- In Assignment 1, we dive into fundamental concepts of machine learning. We explore HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) features, a powerful technique for object detection and image analysis. Additionally, we delve into the intricacies of confusion matrices, providing insights into model performance evaluation. Our journey includes model inspection to understand what goes on behind the scenes and thorough model evaluation to gauge the effectiveness of our machine learning approach.

### Assignment 2
- Assignment 2 takes us further into the world of machine learning engineering. We focus on data preprocessing by creating pipelines with various data encodings, including categorical data handling. We also investigate feature importance to identify the key drivers in our models. Moreover, we explore the fascinating realm of text embeddings, an essential component in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

### Assignment 3 
- In Assignment 3, we embark on the adventure of building our own Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We dive deep into the design and architecture of custom CNNs. Additionally, we inspect activation layers to understand how information flows through our network. As a bonus challenge, we enhance a pre-trained CNN with our own unique additions, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in computer vision.

These assignments collectively provide a comprehensive journey through the diverse and exciting field of Machine Learning Engineering.
