## Instructions for completing the assignment
* Congratulations, you successfully started the assignment!
* Clone this repo to your local machine (or a hosted service such as Google Colab)
* Answer the questions in the notebook 'Assignment_1_2023.ipynb'
* Make sure that all answers are self-contained. Define additional variables and helper functions inside the functions you are asked to implement. Avoid using global variables.
* Your notebook should run top-to-bottom (e.g. run 'Restart kernel and run all cells').
* Push your solution to Github Classroom. Make sure that you commit everything, especially your assignment notebook. As usual:

```
git add -A
git commit -m "commit message"
git push
```

### Self-verification
* We added small validation tests after every question in the notebook, make sure that these all pass. They do not check for correctness, only that your answer is in the correct form.
* An automated unit test will also be run automatically on GitHub. This basically tries to run your notebook top to bottom again. Check your github page to follow status. An orange dot means it is still running, a green check means that everything is fine.
* If the automated test fails (you see a red cross), click it to check what went wrong. This does not automatically mean that your solution is wrong. There can be other unexpected reasons as well.
* We recommend committing an empty solution right away (e.g. by changing a single character) so that you are familiar with the submission procedure. This avoids unexpected surprises near the submission deadline. If ou submit an empty solution, the unit tests should fail on one of the validation tests because you haven't completed it yet.
